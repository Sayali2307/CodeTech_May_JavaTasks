Description :

<1> Calculator :
The calculator program is a simple Java application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers. Here's an overview of its functionality:
Input:

The program prompts the user to enter two numbers.
It then asks the user to select an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.

Operations:
i> Addition: Adds the two numbers together.
ii> Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
iii> Multiplication: Multiplies the two numbers.
iv> Division: Divides the first number by the second, handling division by zero as an error.

Output:
After performing the selected operation, the program displays the result to the user.
Error Handling:
The program handles division by zero, ensuring that it doesn't crash if the user attempts such an operation.
User Interaction:
The calculator interacts with the user via the console, displaying prompts and receiving input.

Structure:
The program is structured using a simple switch-case statement to perform the selected operation.

Termination:
The program terminates after displaying the result to the user.

Conclusion :
 The calculator program provides a practical solution for performing arithmetic calculations quickly and efficiently. It serves as a foundational example for understanding and implementing basic calculator functionalities in Java,

<2> Student Grade Tracker :

The student grade tracker program is a Java application designed to help users manage and track grades for various subjects or assignments. Here's an overview of its features:

Grade Management:
Users can add, edit, and delete grades for different subjects.
Each grade consists of a subject name and a numerical grade.

Input:
The program allows users to input grades for different subjects or assignments.

Average Calculation:
It calculates the average grade based on the grades entered by the user.

Display:
The program displays the entered grades along with the average grade to the user.

Additional Information:
It provides additional information such as letter grades or GPA (not implemented in the provided code).

User Interaction:
Interaction with the program is done through a console interface, where users can choose options to add, edit, delete, or display grades.

Error Handling:
The program handles cases where the user tries to edit or delete a grade that doesn't exist.

Structure:
The program is structured using object-oriented principles, with classes for representing grades and the grade tracker itself.

Termination:
The program continues running until the user chooses to exit, providing a persistent interface for managing grades.

Conclusion :
The student grade tracker program serves as an effective tool for students or educators to organize and monitor academic progress,
